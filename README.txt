To run the codes, navigate to testcase.py's bottom part to find the configurations of the test case. 
To change the propagator, enter either 'BC', 'FC', or 'GAC' for the 'propagator' variable on line 1485. The default flag is GAC.
To change the model to binarary or all different, set the variable 'model' to either 'binary' or 'all diff' respectively.
To change the scope of the test cases, set the 'test_case_scope' variable to equal the array name of the array of test boards. "X_rows_filled_tests" are test cases where the board has partial solution of X rows filled in. This is used to lower the difficulty of the board to prevent some of the models or propagators from generating results. The 'up_to_X' test cases are all of the X_rows_filled_tests up to amount X. 'all_boards' will include all the predefined test cases we found online.
The difficulty is defined by how close the initial board is compared to the solution of the board.
